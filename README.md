I am Ahnaf Tajwar. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in University of Dhaka.
I know a bit of Python, C (and C++), Perl, R and SQL. I am currently working on expanding my knowledge of Python. I am also interested in web development and am actively looking for a good web development course for a certificate.
