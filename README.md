A lifelong curiosity about how things work, sparked by childhood reading, seeded my deep interest in science. Biology was especially fascinating during my SSC and HSC years, and I became excited by genetic engineering's potential to not just understand life, but also reshape it â€“ thatâ€™s what led me to study Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology.

At university, I gained a solid understanding of molecular biology, biotechnology, genetics, microbiology, and biochemistry, along with hands-on skill in lab techniques like recombinant DNA technology, microbial assays, plant sample extraction, and TLC bioautography.

My research experience combines hands-on lab work with computational analysis. Iâ€™ve contributed to clinical trial integrity by managing lab operations, setting up and standardizing reliable sample handling protocols, and ensuring clear communication through localization efforts â€“ all supported by a solid understanding of regulatory requirements.

Using computational tools, I've analyzed bacterial pathogenicity by functionally annotating hypothetical proteins and analyzing virulence factors using bioinformatics methods. I have also taken part in several other projects where I assisted with data analysis and visualization. I genuinely love diving into data and extracting insights from them.

Beyond lab work, I love to share the passion and understanding that I gained about the world. Mentoring junior researchers in experimental design and analysis or guiding health workers at icddr,b in careful sample collection and handling are responsibilities I find come naturally when called upon. I've also designed and set up digital documentation systems to improve clinical study management.

I tackle challenges with adaptability and a focus on quality, and enjoy looking at problems from different angles. I strongly believe that combining knowledge from different fields leads to better understanding and stronger solutions than sticking to just one specialty. My goal is to use this mix of molecular biology knowledge, data analysis skills, and my collaborative approach for impactful research and innovation.
