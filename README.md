Ever since I was a kid, glued to books like they were portals to other worlds, I've been captivated by the universe's secrets. This fascination with how things really work sparked a passion for science that's only grown stronger. Biology, especially, drew me in during my SSC and HSC years. The idea that we could not just understand life but potentially reshape it through genetic engineering felt revolutionary. That's what led me to pursue degrees in Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology.

University was where I truly immersed myself in the molecular world, gaining a solid understanding of molecular biology, biotechnology, genetics, microbiology, and biochemistry. But it wasn't just theory; I got my hands dirty in the lab, mastering techniques like clinical sample processing, rDNA technology, microbial assays, plant sample extraction, and TLC.

My research experience has been a blend of hands-on lab work and computational analysis. I've played a part in clinical trials, helping create informed consent documents, establish protocols, and ensure a sterile working environment. I also helped bridge the communication gap by translating key documents for the local community.

On the bioinformatics side, I've delved into the mysteries of hypothetical proteins in a bacterial strain, exploring their potential role in causing disease. I also assisted with data collection and processing to analyze the virulence factors of another bacterial species.

Beyond the lab, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge. As a research assistant at the University of Dhaka, I had the chance to mentor junior researchers, guiding them through experimental design, data gathering, and analysis. It's incredibly rewarding to help others learn and grow.

I'm driven to do high-quality work, and I have a knack for detail. But I'm also flexible and quick to adapt. I love a good challenge and enjoy exploring problems from multiple perspectives.  I'm a firm believer that a broad, interdisciplinary understanding is far more powerful than narrow expertise.
